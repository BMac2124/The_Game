# Force Matching

I do not own the rights to any of these pics used on this project.  I would like to give credit to Disney/Lucas Films.  This is meant to be a fun game for those that are "Star Wars" fans. "Force Matching," was meant to be a fun project for me to show homage to my love for the films, and for love of memory games.  

On this project I used the following: 
HTML: I used Class/Id
CSS: I styled my div with grid and and center my text with text align
JS:  For the logic in the Javascript I used Array; .sort(); .append(); document.createElement; addEventListner; for loops, iteration, and .push()
